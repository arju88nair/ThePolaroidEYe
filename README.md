# ThePolaroidEYe

The Polaroid Eye is done in PHP using Laravel 5.3 as the framework and MongoDB as the database.

For setting up the project in an Ubuntu pc or server,you can follow this tutorial http://tecadmin.net/setup-mongodb-php5-apache2-ubuntu/#

By following the file structure of Laravel,one can get the available routes in the web.php in the routes folder.

The index page of the project will be the root address, as http://localhost/ThePolaroidEye/public/ for example.

Since there were no web hosting server available for me at the time of production for this project,all the testing and development had been done in the local server.

Instead of creating different web pages for the upload and search,all the functionalities have been done in a single page with minimal calls

After selecting the desired hue,adjusting the spread slider will populate the results.
